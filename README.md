# Mask-detetection-System
A real-time face mask detection application built with Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras. The system uses a pre-trained SSD face detector and a CNN-based classifier to identify whether a person is wearing a mask or not from live video streams.

# Features:

- Real-time face detection using OpenCV
- Mask vs. No Mask classification with high accuracy
- Live video stream integration with bounding boxes & probability scores
- Practical application for monitoring public safety

# Tech Stack:
  Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas
